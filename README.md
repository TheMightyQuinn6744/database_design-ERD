# database_design-ERD
Database design using ERD's with PostgreSQL

#Project Goal
Designed database by creating an entity relationship diagram (ERD) in the PostgreSQL databaser service using the pgAdmin graphical user interface (GUI) tool. Using the (ERD) in PostgreSQL I will generate an SQL script to create the database schema. Finally I will load the tar file containing the data for the database schema in PostgresSQL by restoring from local file on desktop.

#Included files
--HR_Schema.sql (SQL script including HR schema to be loaded in pgAdmin4)
--HR_pgsql_dump_data.tar (TAR file including data to be loaded into HR Schema once loaded)
--README.md (Contains project goals + short file descriptions)
